import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

i am considering that u know till this part 

#Importing database 
dataset= pd.read_csv('train.csv')
>>As u know i have imported the Data set

X=dataset.drop(['Name','Ticket','Cabin','Embarked','Survived'],axis=1).values
>>Now here is a catch i have eliminated all the unwanted coulmns fron the data and made our 
>>Dependent varible dataset

Y=dataset.iloc[:,1].values
>> Here i created the vector my dependent varible note : indecates the coulmn here 


#Handling the categorical data
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
labelencoder_X = LabelEncoder()
X[:, 2] = labelencoder_X.fit_transform(X[:, 2])

>>Now above code is for trasforming the male female into 1 and 0 , its called categorical Data handling 
>>dont worry abt oneHotEncoder u will understand it after wards 


# Handling the missing data
from sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer
imputer = Imputer(missing_values = 'NaN', strategy = 'most_frequent', axis = 0)
imputer = imputer.fit(X[:, [3]])
X[:,[3]] = imputer.transform(X[:,[3]])

>>As u can see i have replaced some missing ages with most frequent ages  

#Data spliting 
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(X,Y,test_size=0.2,random_state=0)

>>Here i have split my dataset in the traing and test set in 20 - 80 ratio that means i 
>> wiil feed 80 % data to our machine to learn and we will use 20% data to test our model 
>> Aliraz u have to make decision here weather we shoould use this all data set or test.csv


# Implementing the random forest 
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

y_pred = classifier.predict(x_test)

# Making the Confusion Matrix
